  The sun dipped below the Golden Gate Bridge, casting a warm
    glow on our picnic table at Crissy Field. I grabbed the petite
    bottle with its distinctive diamond label. A few drops of Tabasco
    onto the sizzling patties worked like magic, releasing a spicy
    aroma. The tangy burgers were a perfect beachside treat. The zesty
    and peppery kick elevated the smoky char of the burgers, leaving a
    lingering heat that danced on my palate without overwhelming the
    burger. The combination of the rich, savory meat and the vibrant
    punch of Tabasco was perfect.

    Tabasco is a reliable sidekick in the hot sauce pantry as
    perhaps the most common staple. The first time I’m trying to add
    heat to a dish, I’ll start with a couple of dashes of
    Tabasco. From eggs to veggies to burgers to pizza, it’s a true
    winner for its universal appeal. It's not for heat connoisseurs
    who want a blast, but its moderate spiciness and balanced acidity
    make it a crowd-pleaser. Consider adding a few dashes (or
    substituting it for salt) in soups, stews, grilled meats, and
    avocado toast, and don’t forget to enjoy it with the occasional
    bloody mary!
